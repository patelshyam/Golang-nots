# Golang-nots

## Why should you learn Golang?
- Code runs fast
- Garbage collection
- Simpler objects
- Concurrency is efficient

## Software Translation

**Machine-Language:** CPU instructions represented in binary
**Assembly-Language:** CPU instruction with mnemonics
- Easier to read
- Equvivelent to machine Language.

**High-level Languages:** Much easier to write
C, C++, Java, Python, Go, etc

- When writing code in a high-level language. That code must first be translated into machine-level language before it can be executed. Then you may put it into action.
- There are two ways using which machine level Compiler and Interpreter.
- Generally compiled code are much faster then Interpreted codes so, Golang is a good trade of between compiled and interpreted language.
- It will give you the spped with Garbage collection. Like c++ with Garbage collector.
